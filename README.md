# Disco Revival

This is the source code for our Ludum Dare 46 game "Disco Revival".

## Instructions

You are the dj of a raving club, but it turns out there are some sticks in the mud that won't dance. It's your job to take out (fingerbang) the boring population before they over run the club. Will you be able to save the party?
